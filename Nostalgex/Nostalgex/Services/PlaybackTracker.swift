/// With neither reporter, it only accumulates watch time for analytics.
///
/// Scrobble rule (hybrid gate), same on every server:
///   1. Entry gate — tuned in during the first 15% of the program
///   2. Active time — accumulated ≥ 75% of total runtime while this tracker is active
/// Both gates must pass. The count increments as soon as the threshold is crossed or on stop.
///
/// Continue Watching: reporting must never leave a program in the user's Continue
/// Watching, Resume or On Deck rows.
/// - Plex: every timeline report is position-free (PR #18), so Now Playing sees the title
///   and whether it is playing, paused or buffering, and Plex stores nothing. A counted
///   episode's next-up entry is removed unless its show was already in Continue Watching.
/// - Jellyfin/Emby: reports carry the position (a stop without one marks the item played),
///   so the tracker reads UserData before the first report and writes it back when the
///   session ends, the app backgrounds or the user turns reporting off.
/// See `WatchCleanupPlan`. Every server call goes through one `ReportQueue`, so cleanup
/// always lands after the last report. A server that stops answering gets fewer pulses
/// (`PulseBackoff`); nothing here ever changes the user's setting.
